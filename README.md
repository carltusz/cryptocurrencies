# cryptocurrencies

## Overview

In this project, cryptocurrencies were analysed and classified using unsupervised machine learning. The currencies were sorted based on algorithm, coins mined, total coin supply, and proof type.

2d and 3d plots were created to show the output of the machine learning models.
